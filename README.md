Hi, I’m James! 👋 I'm a passionate Full-Stack Software Engineer specializing in building modern, scalable, and user-centric web applications. My go-to stack is **React**, **Vite**, **Nest.JS**, and **PostgreSQL**, and I thrive on turning complex problems into elegant, efficient software solutions.

Following my recent role as a Software Engineer at **Grubhub**, I've been channeling my energy into what I love most: building impactful applications from the ground up. I'm actively developing new projects, expanding my expertise, and seeking my next professional challenge.

### 🚀 What I'm Currently Building

I believe the best way to grow is to build. Here are some of the projects I've been working on:

#### 🏆 Featured Project: Property Maintenance & 360° Visualization Platform for Ironview Maintenance

I architected and built a comprehensive, enterprise-grade property maintenance application from scratch for a real-world client. This platform is designed to streamline operations for large-scale apartment buildings.

* **Key Features:**
    * **Interactive 360° Panoramas:** Users can navigate virtual building interiors and attach maintenance requests, work orders, and item labels directly to specific points ("hotspots") within a panoramic image.
    * **"X-Ray Vision" Infrastructure Mapping:** By using pre-construction photos, the platform gives maintenance teams an unprecedented view of in-wall infrastructure like electrical and plumbing, dramatically reducing guesswork and repair time.
    * **Full Work Order Lifecycle Management:** Create, assign, and track work orders with detailed checklists and status updates.
    * **Advanced Team & Access Control:** Features a robust system for managing maintenance teams with custom roles and granular permissions.
* **Tech Stack:** React, React Query, Vite, Nest.JS, Node.js, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, PostgreSQL.

#### 📦 CuttingBoardCorner.com & NFC Integration

A unique platform that bridges the gap between my physical craftsmanship (woodworking) and the digital world.

* I embed **NFC tags** into custom cutting boards I create.
* When a customer taps their phone to a board, it directs them to a personalized portal where they can:
    * Authenticate via Google OAuth.
    * View their registered products and specific care instructions.
    * Save and organize their favorite recipes and videos with personal notes.
    * An admin panel allows for product and user management.

#### 🔧 Other Projects

* **Scalable Nest.JS Backend Service:** A robust, multi-tenant backend foundation designed to serve multiple frontend applications. Features secure authentication, PostgreSQL integration, and a sub-app generator for rapid development.
* **OnlyBizLinks.com:** A fast and clean Linktree-style application.
* **Woodworker's Project Manager (v2):** A complete overhaul and modernization of one of my first major projects.
