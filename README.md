- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m James!
- ðŸ‘€ I LOVE full stack web app development
- ðŸ‘” I was recently part of the layoffs at Grubhub where I was working as a software engineer
- ðŸŒ± I'm expanding my skills every day by building new apps and using new technologies
- ðŸŒ± I've got several personal projects underway including:
  - A Nest.JS backend with Auth, Postgres integration, and a subapp generator so that it can handle multiple frontend apps!
  - OnlyBizLinks.com - basically a linktree clone for now
  - Woodworker's Project Manager - This one was my first project years ago, it's being re-made and needs a complete overhaul
  - CuttingBoardCorner.com - Still much to do, buit mostly in MVP form:
    -  I embed NFC tags in my cutting boards and program them to send a user to this site
    -  They can log in via Google and they'll be able to see the following:
      -  Products they own, care instructions, links to purchase more items, and a feature for saving links to their favorite recipes and videos with notes!
      -  The admin section allows a user with admin permission to see/add/delete products, edit their info, and link any product to a user after it's been sold
