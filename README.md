- 👋 Hi, I’m James!

- 👔 Currently I'm working for Grubhub as an operations Engineer and I own a woodworking business specializing in exotic cutting boards
- 🌱 I'm expanding my skills every day by building new apps and using new technologies
- 🌱 My big personal project is a NestJS boilerplate backend that can be reused over and over again for my future web apps
  - It includes a user feature with jwt access and refresh tokens, password and token encryption, and a password reset feature
